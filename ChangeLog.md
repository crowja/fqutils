# 0.4.0 release
* Introduced fqu_cull to pull selected records from a FASTQ stream. Fqu_split already does something similar, but can't act as a filter.
* First man pages hacked into existence.


# 0.3.1 minor release
* Added --check-initial option to fqu_wc to check only the first few words
of a sequence rather than all.
